## Sets
N subset Z subset Q subset R subset C

N natural numbers (0,) 1,2,...  
Z integer numbers ..., -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, ...  
Q ratinal numbers $p/q$ whare p and q are integers (and q != 0)  
R real numbers  
C complex numbers $a+b*i$ where a and b are real  
(I imaganary numbers)  

## Decimal expansion
1/7 = 0.142857|142857|  
1/2 = 0.5|0|  
1/3 = 0.3|3|  

## Intervals
[] included <=  
() excluded (always used with inf) <  
x in $[0,1)$ would be 0 <= x < 1  
$[1, inf)$ would be 1 <= x ( < inf)  

$\cup$ union  
$\cap$ intersection  
E element of  
$\lor$ or  
$\land$ and  
=> form A follows B  
<=> A => B and A <= B  
A/B  
all x $\in$ A for wich x $\notin$ B  

$(0,1) \cup (\frac1 2,2] = (0,2]$  
$(0,1) \cap (\frac1 2,2] = (\frac1 2,1)$

## polynomial
Degree (order): is the highest ocurring power (in its reduced/simplified form)
they can be use to aproximate other functions

can be factered into linear terms (with all the roots)

can be divided to get a lesser degree
or substitution can be used to do the same.

### Quadratic
use discrimanant b^2-4ac for ax^2+bx+c to get the amount of solutions
x=0 is 1
x<0 is none
x>0 is two
